# UFO_Sightings
Helping Dana learn vanilla JavaScript by using ES6 update.

Dana learned about basic JavaScript components, such as: creating a table to organize UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array, structure JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases, build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions, apply forEach loops, and populate a dynamic filter with a table using JavaScript and HTML.

By visiting the site, one could filter through any categories, and combine such categories to look for a specific sighting.

One recommendation could be add another filter for the duration of sighting, or to compile/scrape more data to further extend the list.
